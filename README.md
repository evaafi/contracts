# Technical smart-contract README
TLB schemas for transactions body and storage can be found in the ./schema folder. 

# Folder structure in ./contracts
- `/` - root code files, each compiling to a separate smart contract
- `/core` - main code of the protocol (rcv opcode -> parse incoming tx -> execute some logic (call functions from /logic folder) -> send outcoming tx)
- `/logic` - main logic functions of the protocol
- `/data` - functions to work with data: packers, unpackers, `.store_X`, `~load_X`, etc. - everything intermediate, which is not used as a "final" type (storage or message)
- `/storage` - functions for pack / unpack & save / read storage of user & master sc 
- `/messages` - "final" types, which represent messages and function to work with them
- `/constants` - files with constants (op codes, errors, fees), a lot of them
- `/external` - everything not directly related to EVAA

# Main data types

## Master sc

### asset_config_collection
Dict: asset_id -> `asset_config`
Configuration of a particular asset, which is set during its initialization and is not changed (admin can only change it if very necessary).

### asset_dynamics_collection
Dict: asset_id -> `asset_dynamics`
Information about current changing data (sRate, bRate, etc.), related to a specific asset.

## User sc 

### user_principals
Dictionary: asset -> balance (positive for deposits and negative for debts).

### user_rewards 
Dictionary: asset -> tracking_indexes & tracking_accrued (information about how many rea user will receive for positions in a particular token).

## Various
`asset_id` â‰ˆ `sha256 from ticker of the token (e.g. 'TON' 'jUSDT' 'jUSDC')`
